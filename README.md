# Turtle Graphics Dog Drawing
This Python script uses the turtle module to create a drawing of a dog using various shapes and colors. The turtle graphics library provides an interactive way to create drawings and designs.

## Usage
- Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
- Copy the provided code into a .py file, for example, dog_drawing.py.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the .py file.
- Run the script using the following command:

### python dog_drawing.py
The turtle graphics window will open, and you'll see a drawing of a dog.
## Description
The script uses various elements to create the dog drawing, including the head, eyes, mouth, feet, body, legs, and tail. Each element is defined with its position, size, and color. The rectangle function is used to draw the different shapes.

## Drawing the Dog
The turtle is set up with the initial position and settings.
The draw_dog function is defined to iterate through a list of dog elements, each with its position, size, and color. The rectangle function is called to draw each element.
After defining the draw_dog function, it's invoked to draw the complete dog.
## Example
For a visual example of the dog drawing created by the script, please refer to the turtle graphics window that opens when you run the script.
